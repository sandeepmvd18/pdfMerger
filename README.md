# PDF Merger

This Python script allows you to merge multiple PDF files into a single PDF file. It utilizes the PyPDF2 library to perform the merging process.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Install the PyPDF2 library using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install PyPDF2
    ```

3. Download the `pdfMerger.py` script from this repository.

## Usage

1. Place all the PDF files you want to merge into the same directory as the `pdfMerger.py` script.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the script and your PDF files.

3. Run the script using the following command:

    
    python pdfMerger.py
    

4. Once the script finishes executing, you will find a file named `combined.pdf` in the same directory, which contains all the merged PDF files.

## Customization

You can customize the script further according to your requirements. For example:

- Modify the script to merge PDF files from a specific directory.
- Implement error handling to handle cases where there are no PDF files to merge.
- Add functionality to specify the output file name or location.
